## Problem Definition 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that can interfere with daily functioning or development. The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is commonly used by mental health professionals. The core symptoms are grouped into two main categories: inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. To receive a diagnosis of ADHD, an individual must exhibit a sufficient number of symptoms from one or both categories, and these symptoms should significantly impact their social, academic, or occupational functioning.
## Approach and Tools / Techniques 
 using deep learning methods to predict ADHD and evaluate the performance on a related population of ADHD, the data i used consists of two types of files: fMRI files and atlas files. fMRI files are brain images that measure the blood flow in different regions of the brain over time. Atlas files are three dimensional images that group sections of the fMRI as regions that are related. Applying the atlas reduces the data from the fMRI to a vector of the average signal intensity of each region in the subject’s brain. This is applied to each of the fMRIs in the project to create a single subject by region intensity matrix to build a model from.
## Project Objectives
The aim is to support both parents and children with ADHD by providing a range of resources, tools and technologies to help diagnose, track Manage Symptoms as well as improve communication, socialization, and emotional skills. Specifically, the goal is to help parents diagnose and track their children’s progress, provide advice and resources for dealing with behavioral challenges, and provide interactive environments to improve communication and social skills for children with ADHD.
### Software Objective:
* To do list with reward to improve attention and problem-solving skills.
* Group that facilitates communication between families and the application.
* Supports collaboration with professional doctors and ADHD coaches.
* Help parents develop ways to understand and guide their child’s behavior.
* Options for building a healthy, manageable routine
* An eating system suitable for people with illness and beneficial foods.
* Social skills training.
* Evaluation of the child's condition to see if there is improvement or not.
* Makes AI-based suggestions
### Children Objective:
* Improve their communication skills by providing interactive environments for them
* How to express their feelings and know other emotion
* Control behavior
* Give them some activities to improve their skills
* Develop conversational skills for interacting with others
### Parents Objective:
* Helping parents to diagnose their children
* Helping parents to know how to deals with their children 
* Help them to track their children and give them feedback about children’s progress
* Give them advice about how to deal with them and even in their fits
* Provide resources such as learning, training, and play to help children with ADHD
## Challenges
My project aimed to rehabilitate children with ADHD through interactive activities using technology and AI. However, I faced several challenges during the implementation. Firstly, developing effective and engaging activities for children with ADHD was challenging. ADHD presents a wide range of symptoms, and individual needs are crucial. However, I found that tailoring activities to each child's specific strengths and weaknesses significantly boosted their engagement.Secondly, developing a mobile application for ADHD treatment required creating a user-friendly and accessible interface for children with varying abilities. It also needed regular updates and improvements to provide the best possible support.

Lastly, developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to diagnose children with ADHD involved extensive data collection and analysis, which proved to be time-consuming and difficult. Ensuring the model's accuracy and reliability in diagnosing ADHD required thorough validation and testing. Despite these challenges, I believed that the project had the potential to make a significant positive impact on the lives of children with ADHD by providing them with personalized, engaging, and effective treatment options.
