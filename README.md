(i)problem definition: 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that can interfere with daily functioning or development. The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is commonly used by mental health professionals. The core symptoms are grouped into two main categories: inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. To receive a diagnosis of ADHD, an individual must exhibit a sufficient number of symptoms from one or both categories, and these symptoms should significantly impact their social, academic, or occupational functioning. 
(ii)Approach and tools/techniques: 
1) We used AI Technology to diagnose the disease more accurately than normal question diagnosis:
By using deep learning methods to predict ADHD and evaluate the performance on a related population of ADHD, the data we used consists of two types of files: fMRI files and atlas files. fMRI files are brain images that measure the blood flow in different regions of the brain over time. Atlas files are three dimensional images that group sections of the fMRI as regions that are related. Applying the atlas reduces the data from the fMRI to a vector of the average signal intensity of each region in the subjectâ€™s brain. This is applied to each of the fMRIs in the project to create a single subject by region intensity matrix to build a model from 
(iii) overview of system modules:
Science: 
Imagine an innovative ADHD application that revolutionizes the diagnostic process by integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology with cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI). This groundbreaking application not only serves as a comprehensive support tool for individuals with ADHD but also introduces a novel dimension of precision through neuroimaging. By utilizing fMRI data, the app employs AI algorithms to analyze neural activity patterns associated with ADHD, providing users with a more accurate and personalized diagnosis. This forward-thinking approach enables a deeper understanding of the neurobiological basis of ADHD, facilitating tailored interventions and strategies. Beyond diagnosis, the application harnesses AI to continually adapt and enhance its effectiveness, offering personalized interventions, cognitive training exercises, and progress tracking. This melding of fMRI and AI in an ADHD application represents a transformative step towards a more nuanced and targeted approach to understanding and managing this neurodevelopmental disorder.
